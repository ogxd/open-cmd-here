# Open Cmd Here
A Windows shell tool to open a new command line window at the current folder location (a.k.a. Cmd, DOS, batch, ...).

This feature was natively available in Windows 10 until a few years ago when it got replaced with powershell.
This tool enables this open command window in the current directory again !
